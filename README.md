This Team Profile Generator produces a Profile for all team members based on user input. Role-specific questions are asked when prompted, and when the
user is done entering team members, an HTML document is generated displaying all of the user's input. The application can be run from the command line
using node index.js and the application itilizes the Node Inquirer package.

The link below provides a brief walkthrough of the application.
